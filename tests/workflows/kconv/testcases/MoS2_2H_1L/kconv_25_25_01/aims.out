  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -5.81704977 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:     169 at    0.360000    0.320000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -4.10936461 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000
  | K-point:     161 at    0.320000    0.840000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      1.70768515 eV between HOMO at k-point 169 and LUMO at k-point 161
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      2.04654254 eV for k_point 169 at    0.320000    0.840000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -5.96088356 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:     169 at    0.360000    0.320000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -4.14318247 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000
  | K-point:     169 at    0.360000    0.320000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      1.81770109 eV between HOMO at k-point 169 and LUMO at k-point 169
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :        -132996.547282944 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :        -132996.547282944 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :             -1.088026722 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

  Of course, there are many other important community references, e.g., those cited in the
  above references. Our list is limited to references that describe implementations in the
  FHI-aims code. The reason is purely practical (length of this list) - please credit others as well.

   One or more s.c.f. cycles took more than 50 s.c.f. iterations.
   It might be worth adjusting your convergence settings. For example,
   metals need a larger broadening and a smaller "charge_mix_param" value than semiconductors.
