 * No s.c.f. convergence criteria (sc_accuracy_*) were provided in control.in.

 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :          -2074.200361491 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :          -2074.200361491 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :             -0.467386066 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

  FHI-aims code. The reason is purely practical (length of this list) - please credit others as well.

          | Peak values for overall tracked memory usage:
          |   Minimum:       19.033 MB (on task 22 after allocating gradient_basis_wave)
          |   Maximum:       19.922 MB (on task  9 after allocating gradient_basis_wave)
          |   Average:       19.449 MB
          | Largest tracked array allocation:
          |   Minimum:        8.784 MB (hamiltonian_shell on task 22)
          |   Maximum:        9.383 MB (hamiltonian_shell on task  9)
          |   Average:        9.063 MB
          Note:  These values currently only include a subset of arrays which are explicitly tracked.
          The "true" memory usage will be greater.

          Have a nice day.
