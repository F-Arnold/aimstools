 * No s.c.f. convergence criteria (sc_accuracy_*) were provided in control.in.

 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :          -2074.199386314 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :          -2074.199386314 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :             -0.467370508 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

  Of course, there are many other important community references, e.g., those cited in the
  above references. Our list is limited to references that describe implementations in the
  FHI-aims code. The reason is purely practical (length of this list) - please credit others as well.

          Partial memory accounting:
          | Residual value for overall tracked memory usage across tasks:     0.000000 MB (should be 0.000000 MB)
          | Peak values for overall tracked memory usage:
          |   Minimum:       18.861 MB (on task 22 after allocating gradient_basis_wave)
          |   Maximum:       19.765 MB (on task  9 after allocating gradient_basis_wave)
          |   Average:       19.283 MB
          | Largest tracked array allocation:
          |   Minimum:        8.784 MB (hamiltonian_shell on task 22)
          |   Maximum:        9.383 MB (hamiltonian_shell on task  9)
          |   Average:        9.063 MB
          Note:  These values currently only include a subset of arrays which are explicitly tracked.
          The "true" memory usage will be greater.

          Have a nice day.
