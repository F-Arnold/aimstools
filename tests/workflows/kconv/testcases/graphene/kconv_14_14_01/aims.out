  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -4.91956849 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:      44 at    0.285714    0.357143    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -3.69675859 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000
  | K-point:      44 at    0.285714    0.357143    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      1.22280990 eV between HOMO at k-point 44 and LUMO at k-point 44
  | This appears to be a direct band gap.
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :          -2074.200499231 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :          -2074.200499231 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :             -0.467384423 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.
