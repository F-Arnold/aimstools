 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.97545360 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      2.00000000
  | K-point:   10237 at    0.655172    0.655172    0.827586 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.61289129 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000004
  | K-point:   10231 at    0.655172    0.655172    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.36256231 eV between HOMO at k-point 10237 and LUMO at k-point 10231
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.36427902 eV for k_point 10231 at    0.655172    0.655172    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :          -4148.345860829 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :          -4148.345860829 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -13.589357571 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.
