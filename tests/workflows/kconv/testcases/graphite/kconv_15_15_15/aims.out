 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -6.81398488 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.10954958
  | K-point:    1446 at    0.666667    0.666667    0.200000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -6.80736614 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.96054322
  | K-point:     854 at    0.333333    0.333333    0.733333 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.00661874 eV between HOMO at k-point 1446 and LUMO at k-point 854
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.08998020 eV for k_point 851 at    0.333333    0.333333    0.733333 (in units of recip. lattice)
  However, this system has fractional occupation numbers. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :          -4148.342214397 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :          -4148.342457695 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -13.589322112 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.
