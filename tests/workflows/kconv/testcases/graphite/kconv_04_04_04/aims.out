 * Notice: The s.c.f. convergence criterion sc_accuracy_rho was not provided.
 * We used to stop in this case, and ask the user to provide reasonable

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :          -4148.406348320 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :          -4148.406348320 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -13.586388605 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

  Of course, there are many other important community references, e.g., those cited in the

  FHI-aims code. The reason is purely practical (length of this list) - please credit others as well.

          | Peak values for overall tracked memory usage:
          |   Minimum:       61.552 MB (on task  1 after allocating wave)
          |   Maximum:       64.826 MB (on task 16 after allocating wave)
          |   Average:       63.011 MB
          | Largest tracked array allocation:
          |   Minimum:       35.530 MB (hamiltonian_shell on task  1)
          |   Maximum:       38.658 MB (hamiltonian_shell on task 16)
          |   Average:       36.926 MB
          Note:  These values currently only include a subset of arrays which are explicitly tracked.
          The "true" memory usage will be greater.

          Have a nice day.
