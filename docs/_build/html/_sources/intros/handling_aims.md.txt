# Handling AIMS calculations

The **preparation** and **postprocess** module are wrapped in a couple of useful command line tools.

## Sorting finished calculations

```bash
aims_sort.py
```

This script sorts AIMS calculations in a directory into finished ones (converged) and unfinished ones (not_converged).
