Description: # AIMS_tools
        This library contains a personal collection of scripts to handle AIMS calculations. It's mainly meant for private use or to be shared with students and colleagues.
        
        ## Currently implemented features:
        - **Running AIMS:** prepare_aims.py can set up the files for different tasks employing the ASE (single point, geometry optimisation, band structure calculation, atom-projected density of states)
        - **Plotting functionalities:**
        The plotting modules are designed for combinatorial plotting with a lot of flexibility. It's very easy to overlay, compare and arrange plots in different fashions with the in-built classes.
            > **bandstructure.py** can handle band structure plots with scalar relativity, SOC, and mulliken-projection ("fatbands").
        
            > **dos.py** handles atom-projected densities of states. Summing up different DOS contributions or to get the total DOS is easily done.
        
            > **multiplots.py** contains exemplary functions to combine plots in different fashions, for example overlaying ZORA and ZORA+SOC bandstructures or showing bandstructures and DOS side-by-side.
        
            > **To do:** instead of making every module in-line executable, I will provide a superscript that automatically detects the calculation type and provides an easy plotting functionality.
        
        # Installation
        Simply download the zip from github and unpack it. I recommend using a conda environment to handle the package dependencies.
        Then run:
        > python setup.py install
        
        Set the path to the aims species (basis sets) in your environment variables (e.g., in the .bashrc):
        
        export AIMS_SPECIES_DIR="path/to/directory"
        
        - On t3000, this one is "/chemsoft/FHI-aims/stable/species_defaults/"
        - On taurus, this one is "/projects/m_chemie/FHI-aims/FHI-aims_4_Roman/aimsfiles-master/species_defaults/"
        
        
        # Documentation
        I'm working on the documentation. You can find it under docs/_build/html/index.html.
